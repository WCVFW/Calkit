## 🎓 Sample Workflows

### Happy Path: GST Registration

```
1. WEB   → Customer submits GST registration online
2. CRM   → Lead scored (85/100), routed to sales

6. EXEC  → Filed with GST portal
7. GOVT  → Awaiting government approval
8. QA    → Reviewed and approved
9. DEL   → Certificate uploaded, invoice sent ✅
```

### Exception: Payment Failure

```
3. SALES → Payment attempt fails
   ↓ Exception: PF (Payment Failure)
