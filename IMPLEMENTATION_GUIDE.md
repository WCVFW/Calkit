## API Flow Examples

### Creating an Order and Starting Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create order
POST /api/orders
{
  "leadId": 123,
  "serviceType": "GST_REGISTRATION",
  "value": 4999
}

# 2. Log initial event
POST /api/workflow/orders/1002/event
{
  "stage": "WEB",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "description": "Lead captured from website form"
}

# 3. Advance to next stage
POST /api/workflow/orders/1002/advance
{
  "nextStage": "CRM",
  "description": "Lead routed to CRM team"
}
```

### Handling an Exception

```bash
# Log payment failure
POST /api/workflow/orders/1002/exception
{
  "exceptionType": "PF",
  "description": "Payment failed - Retry required",
  "details": "Card declined, customer will retry tomorrow"
}

# Create alert
POST /api/workflow/alerts
{
  "orderId": 1002,
  "alertType": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
  "title": "Payment Failed for Order #1002",
  "message": "Customer's payment was declined. Please follow up.",
  "actionUrl": "/dashboard/orders/1002"
}

# Later, resolve the exception
POST /api/workflow/orders/1002/event
{
  "stage": "PF",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "description": "Payment retry successful"
}
```

### Getting Workflow Progress

```bash
GET /api/workflow/orders/1002/progress

Response:
{
  "orderId": 1002,
  "currentStage": "ONBD",
  "completionPercentage": 45,
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage": "WEB",
      "label": "Web/App Layer",
      "sequence": 1,
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "events": [...]
    },

- Graceful degradation in UI
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance

- Indexed database queries
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Async event processing

### Security

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Happy Path

```
WEB → CRM → SALES → ONBD → CASE → EXEC → GOVT → QA → DEL
```

### Test Case 2: Payment Failure Exception

```
WEB → CRM → SALES (PF detected) → Retry → ONBD → ...
```

### Test Case 3: Missing Documents

```
... → ONBD (MD detected) → Document Upload → CASE → ...
```
